Client and Attorneys both agree to submit any and all disputes each may have against the other to binding individual (single party) arbitration.  Interpretation, enforcement and any proceedings relating to this arbitration agreement are subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. section 1 et seq.  Any proceedings shall be administered in Los Angeles, California by the American Arbitration Association (www.adr.org).  Any dispute concerning this agreement, either in whole or in part—the way it was formed, its applicability, meaning, scope, enforceability, or any claim that all or some part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable—is also subject to arbitration under this agreement and shall be decided by the arbitrator.  This means that both Client and Attorneys are waiving the right to trial by jury or a judge in a court of law on all disputes.  If any provision of this agreement is found to be void or unenforceable, then that provision or provisions shall be severed and the remainder of the agreement shall remain in effect.  Any decision by the arbitrator shall be subject to appeal to a second arbitrator who shall proceed, as far as practicable, pursuant to the laws governing civil appeals in California.
