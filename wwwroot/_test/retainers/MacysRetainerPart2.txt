If no recovery is obtained on behalf of Client, then Attorneys will not be entitled to any legal fees or costs.  If Attorneys resolve Client’s claims as part of a class action, Attorneys will request that the Court award either a percentage of the gross monetary recovery obtained on behalf of the Class or Attorney’s hourly fees (ranging from $285 to $685 per hour) and a risk multiplier plus costs incurred.  If Attorneys resolve Client’s claims on an individual basis, Attorneys will be entitled to either one-third of any monetary recovery obtained or Attorney’s hourly fees (ranging from $285 to $685 per hour), whichever is greater, plus costs incurred.  Client acknowledges that the foregoing fees are not set by law and may be negotiated by Client and Attorneys.
