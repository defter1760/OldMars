Attorneys agree to provide legal services relating to, and only to, Client’s claims against Macy's, Inc. for unpaid overtime, unpaid minimum wages, missed meal and rest breaks, wages not timely paid upon termination, non-compliant wage statements, and claims under California Business & Professions Code sections 17200 et seq.  Client understands that Attorneys currently seek to represent Client and others similarly situated as a Class (and not in separate, individual cases).  Attorneys, however, will pursue Client’s claims on an individual basis should the Court decline to certify a Class with Attorneys appointed as Class Counsel.
