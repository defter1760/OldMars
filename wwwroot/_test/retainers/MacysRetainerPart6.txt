Client acknowledges that at this time there is no conflict and no conflict is foreseen, but that concurrent representation by Attorneys of Client and others who may have the same or similar claims against the same party or parties as Client constitutes the representation of potentially conflicting interests, to the extent that Client’s interests and those of the others are potentially adverse.  Client also understands that in a representative action, such as a class action, the interests of the class or putative class may become adverse to the Client, in which case Client understands and acknowledges that Attorneys will represent the class or putative class interests and not those of Client.  To represent the class or putative class interests, if they become adverse to Client’s, it may be necessary to substitute or add another class representative to the action, file additional actions, end representation of Client, or recommend settlement of the matter despite Client’s disagreement.  Client nevertheless knowingly and voluntarily consents to such concurrent representation by Attorneys.
