Client acknowledges that at this time there is no conflict and no conflict is foreseen, but that concurrent representation by Attorneys of Client and others who may have the same or similar claims against the same party or parties as Client constitutes the representation of potentially conflicting interests, to the extent that Client’s interests and those of the others are potentially adverse.  Client nevertheless knowingly and voluntarily consents to such concurrent representation by Attorneys.
