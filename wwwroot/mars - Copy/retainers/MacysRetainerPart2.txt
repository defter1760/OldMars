Client will never be required to pay Attorneys any fees “out of pocket.”  If no recovery is obtained on behalf of Client, then Attorneys will not be entitled to any legal fees or costs from Client.  Client agrees that Attorneys have earned a $2500 flat fee upon retention per rolling 12 month period, which Attorneys will seek to recover from Macy’s pursuant to the arbitration agreement between Client and Macy’s.  If Attorneys resolve Client’s Claims as part of a class action, Attorneys will request that the Court award either a percentage of the gross monetary recovery obtained on behalf of the Class or Attorneys’ hourly fees (ranging from $285 to $685 per hour) and a risk multiplier plus costs incurred.  If Attorneys resolve Client’s Claims on an individual basis or multi-party/group settlement, Attorneys will be entitled to either one-third of any gross monetary recovery obtained, all flat fees earned, or Attorneys’ hourly fees (ranging from $285 to $685 per hour), whichever of the three is greater, plus costs incurred.  Client acknowledges that the Attorneys’ fees are not set by law and may be negotiated by Client and Attorneys.
