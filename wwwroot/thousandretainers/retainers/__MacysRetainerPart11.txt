Client and Attorneys both agree to submit all disputes each may have against the other to binding individual (single party) arbitration by a neutral arbitrator in Los Angeles.  The arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”).  Any dispute concerning this Agreement—the way it was formed, its applicability, meaning, scope, enforceability, or any claim that all or some part of this Agreement is void or voidable—is likewise subject to arbitration under this Agreement and shall be decided by the arbitrator.  This means that both Client and Attorneys are waiving the right to trial by jury or a judge in a court of law on all disputes, and instead, all disputes shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration.  If any provision of this Agreement is found to be void or unenforceable, then that provision or provisions shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall remain in effect.  Any decision by the arbitrator shall be subject to appeal to a second arbitrator who shall proceed, as far as practicable, pursuant to the laws governing civil appeals in California.
