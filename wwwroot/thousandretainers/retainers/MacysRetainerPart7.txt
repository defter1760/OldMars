Client agrees and gives Attorneys a lien upon any recovery in this litigation, whether by settlement, judgment or otherwise, for the payment of the fees due and advanced costs by Attorneys.  Since a lien may affect Client’s property rights, Client may consult with independent legal counsel of Client’s choice and has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to do so.
