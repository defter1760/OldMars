Installation instructions:
--------------------------

TeeChart for PHP is easy to install. All required files are included into the zip file. You just have to unzip the files to the
directory you want to use.
TeeChart does not require any aditional Loaders to make it work.


To be able to run the TeeChart samples included in the zip file you have to copy the extracted files into the desired path of your 
apache server, for example \www\teechart, which gives the following result :

	\www\teechart\sources\*.*
	\www\teechart\demos\
	\www\teechart\demos\Features
	\www\teechart\demos\JoomlaModule
	\www\teechart\demos\PHPDemos
	\www\teechart\demos\VCLforPHPDemo
	\www\teechart\docs\*.*


Now you should be able to open your browser, point to "http://server/teechart/demos/Features" and see the Demo Features project.
All you need to do in order to make use of the library into your projects is add the libTeeChart.php file (including the server 
path) as a reference (include) into your php files. 


Installation under RadPHP XE2 IDE :
---------------------------------------

If you want to use the TeeChart for PHP library under the "RadPHP XE2" IDE the following steps must be taken :

1) Copy the \teechart folder into the \rpcl folder of "RadPHP XE2" installation, creating the following folders : 
	
	\RadPHP\4.0\rpcl\teechart
	\RadPHP\4.0\rpcl\teechart\sources
	\RadPHP\4.0\rpcl\teechart\demos\*.*
	\RadPHP\4.0\rpcl\teechart\docs\*.*

2) Copy the \teechart\sources\tchart.inc.php and \teechart\sources\tchart.ide.inc.php files into the \rpcl folder of "RadPHP XE2".

3) Open the "RadPHP XE2" IDE, go to "Component -> Packages" menu option, click "Add" and look for the
   "\teechart\sources\TeeChart.package.php" file. This will add the "TeeChart for PHP Components" item into the list of installed 
   packages. Now click OK.

4) If you create a new Delphi for PHP project and go to the design page a new "TeeChart" tab should appear on the Tool Palette. 
You will find the TChartOBj component there. You should be able to select it and place it on the Form as for any other component.

-------------------------------------------------------

If you plan on using TeeChart for PHP in a commercial context you will need to acquire the professional license. Commercial use is 
for example if you use TeeChart on a site to provide a service for paying customers or for example if you are using it in an intranet 
to provide support for internal business processes, i.e. in benefit for a commercial company.

In short, if you use TeeChart where you have an economic advantage (either through paying customers or improving internal business 
processes) this most likely falls under commercial use.
