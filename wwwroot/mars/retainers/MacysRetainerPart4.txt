If Client’s Claims are not resolved as a class action, Client agrees that fees shall be the greater of (1) thirty-three and one-third percent (33 1/3%) of the amount recovered, (2) Attorneys’ hourly fees (from $285 to $725 per hour), or (3) $2,500 per rolling twelve month period, pursuant to the fee provision in Macy’s arbitration agreement, provided that Client shall receive no less than the amount stated in paragraph 3 below.  For calculation of the fee, the fee provision shall always be applied to the recovery first, before deductions for any costs advanced.  Costs advanced by Attorneys, if any, shall be deducted from the recovery after computation of the fee.
