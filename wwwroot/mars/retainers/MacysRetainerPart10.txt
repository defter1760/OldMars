Attorneys represent other clients against Macy’s for similar wage and hour claims which may create a conflict of interest.  Although Attorneys are not currently aware of any actual or reasonably foreseeable adverse effects of divided or shared loyalties, the possibility exists that issues may arise which may materially limit Client by Attorneys’ representation of other clients with similar claims against Macy’s.  Conflicts of interest may include, among other things, conflicting client instructions, divergent client objectives, or the need to advocate inconsistent objectives or positions between Client and other clients.  Client acknowledges and affirms that Client is aware that concurrent representation by Attorneys of Client and other clients with similar claims against the same parties may result in divided or shared attorney-client loyalties.  By signing this Agreement, Client acknowledges this potential conflict of interest, and nevertheless knowingly and voluntarily consents to such concurrent representation by Attorneys, and expressly authorizes Attorneys to represent Client in this matter.  Client may consult with independent legal counsel of Client’s choice at any time regarding this section.
